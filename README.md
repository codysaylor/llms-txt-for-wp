# LLMs.txt for WP

LLMs.txt for WP is a WordPress plugin designed to generate machine-learning-friendly content from your site. It automatically creates an `llms.txt` file that compiles key content in a standardized format, making your site ready for Large Language Models (LLMs). This ensures that your content can be easily discovered and utilized by AI tools and applications.

Additionally, this plugin allows you to access **Markdown versions of your posts** by appending `.md` to the post URLs or by sending an `Accept: text/markdown` header. Posts automatically include a `<link rel="alternate" type="text/markdown">` tag in their HTML `<head>`, and a `Link` HTTP response header pointing to the Markdown version for better discoverability. Markdown responses include an `X-Markdown-Tokens` header indicating the token count of the output.

### About the `llms.txt` Standard

The `llms.txt` standard provides a simple, machine-readable file format for webmasters to communicate how their content should be utilized by Large Language Models (LLMs). It works similarly to `robots.txt`, enabling websites to specify which content is intended for training or reference by AI models. By implementing `llms.txt`, you can:

- **Promote Discovery**: Help LLMs understand the structure and purpose of your site.
- **Define Content Use**: Indicate permissions or restrictions on specific content.
- **Control Visibility**: Exclude or highlight specific sections of your site.

### Key Features

- **Generate llms.txt**: Aggregate key content from your site into an easy-to-read format for machine learning models.
- **Markdown Support**: Generate Markdown versions of posts, suitable for LLMs or for lightweight sharing. Markdown responses include an `X-Markdown-Tokens` header with the token count.
- **Fully Customizable**: Customize which page or posts are included via an intuitive admin settings page.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why use the llms.txt standard?

The `llms.txt` standard allows webmasters to provide structured data for Large Language Models, similar to how `robots.txt` serves search engines. This can improve the discoverability and usability of your content by AI tools, while also giving you control over what is included. It's [quickly becoming a standard practice](https://directory.llmstxt.cloud/) for AI-friendly websites.

### How do I access the Markdown versions of posts?

Once Markdown support is enabled, you can access Markdown versions in three ways:
1. Append `.md` to any post's URL (e.g., `https://example.com/your-post.md`)
2. Send an `Accept: text/markdown` header in your HTTP request
3. Look for the `<link rel="alternate" type="text/markdown">` tag in the post's HTML `<head>` to discover the Markdown URL

Markdown responses also include an `X-Markdown-Tokens` header indicating the approximate token count of the Markdown output, useful for LLM context management.

### Can I control which posts are included in llms.txt?

Yes! The plugin can be configured to include specific post types and limit the number of posts included in the `llms.txt` file. You can also choose to include a specific page only.
